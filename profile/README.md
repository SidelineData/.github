# Welcome!
My name is Joe, and I am the founder (and sole employee) of Sideline Data! Over the last few years I have spent some time designing and building various electronics for fun and to solve my own needs/problems. After some positive feedback I wanted to take a stab at actually selling some of the things I have come up with, so Sideline Data was born! Full disclaimer, while I have _some_ experience, I am not a software developer by trade. I am actually an Information Security professional with a background in infrastructure, virtualization, and information assurance/risk management. I love to learn and continue growing my skillset which is one of the reasons I decided to formalize this a bit! That being said, you may look through my code or designs and ask "why did he do it that way?" or "what was he thinking?" - I probably won't have a good answer for you, so try not to judge too harshly ;)

For now, be sure to [check out my website](https://sidelinedata.com) and if you're interested, sign up (on the site) to get updates on new blog posts or product information! I promise there are no unwanted ads or spam...I just push out emails when I write up a new blog post. Feel free to also poke around the repositories and see what I am working on, for context I will at least introduce you to do the two main things I am working on right now:


### KegWatch
KegWatch is a beer tracking system for your kegerator! Designed to be affordable, simple, and fun. Ease of installation sets KegWatch apart from other keg management solutions. No severed beer lines. No scales. No electronics inside the kegerator. Simply place the unit on top of your beer tower, attach the included magnets to your tap handles, and you are ready to go!  KegWatch looks for the tap handles to open and close and estimates the amount of beer poured based on the flow rate of **your** draft system!


### HopperHawk
HopperHawk is a device designed to sit inside the hopper of a pellet smoker. It's a real time sensor that takes measurements of the hopper and can report how full (or empty) it is during a smoke! Use the custom app (in development) or connect it via MQTT to Home Assistant. HopperHawk is powered by a rechargeable Lithium Ion battery and should last through even a brisket without needing to be plugged in.
